# GroSharies

## Description

Our world is encountering a fast-growing problem of food waste, in fact â€“ about one third of the food in the world is thrown away. The idea of our project is to help to reduce the amount of that massive waste.

To do so, we offer a community-based platform that will allow people to share good, fresh food, which is about to be thrown away unreasonably.

Let us take a Supermarket, for an instance; about 4-5 days before official expiration date, it is not allowed to be sold, and they put it out for the garbage. We offer the ability of reporting that kind of scenario so people could come and enjoy the goods, instead of them being put into waste. A map is provided and enables to explore the recent collectable groceries.
A search engine will offer the users to look up groceries according to their specific needs, including location, categories, amount, etc.

Our users, the people who can share foods and groceries, are divided into two major groups: Private and Business. While private users are able either to share their own or to report left- alone foods, Business users have the option to set fixed days for bulk giveaways.

The project is based on a freegan, anti-consumerist ideology and will be 100% free to use, as well as the goods that are being shared.

The idea is not only to allow, but also to encourage people to reduce food waste, take a good care of nature and to strengthen the sense of community amongst our users.
