            <Typography sx={{ fontSize: "20px", margin: "3em 11em" }}>Our world is encountering a fast-growing problem of food waste, in fact â€“ about one third of the food in the world is thrown away. The idea of our project is to help to reduce the amount of that massive waste. To do so, we offer a community-based platform that will allow people to share good, fresh food, which is about to be thrown away unreasonably. The project is based on a freegan, anti-consumerist ideology and will be 100% free to use, as well as the goods that are being shared.</Typography>
